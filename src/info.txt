History Few video games can claim the distinction of being in the
          general consciousness for decades, spanning different generations.
          Super Mario is one of, if not the only one, that has made great
          strides in this area. There's almost no one on the planet who has not
          heard of the Italian plumber in overalls who goes by the name of
          Mario. Those who have never played the game may not be aware of his
          humble beginnings but they have in some shape or form, heard of him.
          Mario wasn’t even the main character in his first appearance in the
          video game. Most importantly, he wasn’t even a plumber and he wasn’t
          called Mario. He made his first appearance in 1981 in the pioneering
          arcade game called Donkey Kong. The character was called Jumpman and
          he was a carpenter.

          When playing, the player is assuming the role of Mario and has to go
          through the Mushroom Kingdom. The player has to survive the evil
          forces of the game’s villain, Bowser, and rescue Princess Toadstool.
          To win the game, Mario has to reach the flag pole at the end of each
          level. There are coins scattered throughout the game which need to be
          collected. There are also special bricks with question marks that
          reveal more coins and other special items once hit. It’s a must to hit
          other bricks if there’s enough time as they might contain rare items
          or coins. Eating a mushroom transforms regular Marion into Super
          Mario, which means he grows double in size and gets the ability to
          break bricks above him. Careful though as when he gets hit in this
          mode, he reverts to his original self, but he won’t die.

          Here's a simple instruction for the obstacle avoiding game:
          <br /><br />
          The player controls a character that is running on a track with
          obstacles. 
          <br />
          The player's goal is to jump over the obstacles by pressing
          the spacebar. 
          <br />
          If the player fails to jump over an obstacle, the game
          ends. 
          <br />
          The further the player can get without colliding with any
          obstacles, the higher the score will be. 
          <br />
          The player can collect items
          along the track to increase the score or grant advantages, such as the
          ability to jump higher or slow down time. 
          <br />
          The game contains multiple
          levels, each with increasingly difficult obstacles. 
          <br />
          The player can
          compete against other players online to see who can get the highest
          score. 
          <br /><br />
          Good luck and have fun!
